Trello2HTML Extended
===

This is a fork of Trello2HTML. See below for information on the
original. In this version, you can select which lists to show, which
members and labels to include, and what information is to be displayed.
There is a hosted version of this at http://www.kaseymckenna.com/trello/

Trello2HTML (Original)
===

You can view detailed Trello Boards and export them to HTML (Save Page doesn't
work). An ideal use for this is to generate and print weekly/monthly reports (at
least that is how our team uses it.) Another use of this app is to directly 
append a board id to the hash, for example, the report for the official Trello
Development is http://tianshuo.github.com/trello/#4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c

The hosted version is on http://tianshuo.github.com/trello/ At the present moment,
only Chrome is supported. (I haven't tested firefox yet)

There is also a blog article on this:
